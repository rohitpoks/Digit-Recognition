# Digit-Recognition
Neural network to identify hand-written digits, works well with the train dataset (97% accuracy) however doesn't perform as expected when input is given through the pygame mini-program, mostly because user's handwriting deviates from the dataset that the model is accustomed to. 
It isn't flawless of course but i'll continue working on it in the future.
